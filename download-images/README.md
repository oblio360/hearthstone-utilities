Scripts used to download Hearthstone card images from the Heartpwn CDN.

Input: | separated list of URLs and card names. 

The input is obtained from massaging their pages, for example:

http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/minion?display=3&filter-class=1&filter-premium=1&page=2

until the underlying HTML looks like the list I described above.
